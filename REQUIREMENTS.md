# Business Requirements for Who's Who

***These requirements are subject to change***

## Requirements Overview

We want you to build prototype 'game' idea that we had. It's basically going to be a guessing game. The user will be displayed with 1-3 songs and 2-4 artists pictures/names. The user will be able to play the songs and then they'll have to guess which artist that song belongs too. 

There should probably be a 'configuration' page which lets them pick a genre, the number of songs per guess, and the number of artists to guess from, then it should take them to the 'game' page. I'll leave it up to you to decide how many 'guesses' the user gets before they lose. Make it user friendly and mobile friendly and all that good stuff. Also, keep their settings that they select on the configuration page so if they leave the page and come back, they won't have to reselect everything. By default, select 1 song and 2 artists.

We don't have the money to pay for any premium music service so use Spotify. I think they have a free API. Just use the server that other guy set up that authenticates with Spotify and gives you the token.
